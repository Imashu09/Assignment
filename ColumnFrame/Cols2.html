    <h2 align="Center">JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</h2>
    <img src="cols.png" width="100%">

    <p> Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. Java
    has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years. Java
    is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as
    it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc) The Java
    codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the
    byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
    architecture. Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide
    low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are
    always written in the form of classes and objects. Java is used in all kinds
    of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based), desktop
    applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise
    applications, and many more. When compared with C++, Java codes are
    generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which
    may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example,
    non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large
    objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in
    Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is
    also not possible. When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++
    and Python. The programs are written in Java typically run faster than
    corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does
    static type checking, but Python does not.
