      <h1><font color="B40000">Petrol Price Hike</font></h1> <i>
      India's fuel demand rose to a three-year high in March, with petrol sales
      hitting an all-time peak, as the market accumulated supplies foreseeing
      price spikes, despite which the outlook for the country's post-pandemic
      economic recovery remains promising. Consumption of fuel, a proxy for oil
      demand, rose 4.2% from the same month last year to 19.41 million tonnes,
      its highest since March 2019, according to the country's oil ministry's
      Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell data as on April 9. "March oil demand
      was strongly supported by stockpiling activity/hoarding in anticipation of
      a rise in petrol and diesel prices in the later part of the month," UBS
      analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. Preliminary data this month showed Indian
      state refiners' gasoil and gasoline sales in March surged on increased
      demand from dealers and consumers ahead of an expected sharp rise in
      retail prices after elections in key states. "So this (higher prices)
      likely will weigh on demand prospects in the near term, but with the
      economy still expanding, oil demand is likely to continue recovering over
      the coming months," Staunovo said. Sales of gasoline, or petrol, were 6.2%
      higher from a year earlier at 2.91 million tonnes, their highest ever as
      per data going back to 1998. To mitigate the rising cost of oil imports,
      India has turned to Russian barrels that are available at a deep discount
      citing "national interests". Indian refiners have bought at least 16
      million barrels of cheaper Russian oil for May loading on a delivered
      basis, similar to purchases for the whole of 2021, according to Reuters
      calculations as of last week. While imports of Russian oil have kept
      India's economy, emerging from its pandemic slowdown, on track, "India is
      also needing to tread carefully politically," said Jeffrey Halley, chief
      market analyst at OANDA. porro? </i>
